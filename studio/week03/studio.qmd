## Instructions

[Teams](https://sdsu.instructure.com/courses/157862/assignments/1398296)  
**DUE: Wednesday, September 18, 2024 3:30pm** 

The team leader will submit a pdf version of the notebook showing all the work
to answer the questions.

The first cell of the notebook should have a list of the team members (first and
last names) with the team leader in bold. (Hint: Markdown cell).

## Input Files
The files you will read are:

```
~/data/385/studio03/schools.geojson
~/data/385/studio03/streets.geojson
~/data/385/studio03/catchments.geojson
```


## Reading the spatial data files
Read in each of three data files to create three geodataframes: `schools`,
`catchments`, `streets`
```{python}
import geopandas as gpd

# uncomment the following line and complete the code
# schools = gpd.read_file("???")
```

## Report the number of rows in each GeoDataFrame

## Determine the datatype of the geoseries for each GeoDataFrame

## Determine the student density in each catchment
Assuming that the catchment student populations are 140, 200, 75, create a new variable that is called `sdensity` that is defined as the ratio of the number of students per unit area of the catchment.


## Plot the `sdensity` variable
## Plotting multiple layers

Read the guide on [Control the order of multiple layers in a plot](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/user_guide/mapping.html#control-the-order-of-multiple-layers-in-a-plot) and plot the three layers together on one plot with the catchments below the streets and schools.

Ensure that the different geometries are visually distinguishable.
