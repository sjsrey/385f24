## Introduction

Welcome to GEOG 385: Spatial Data Analysis!


The purpose of this course is to introduce you to methods of spatial data
analysis. The focus is on both the conceptual and applied aspects of spatial
statistical methods. We will place particular emphasis on the computational
aspects of Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) methods for diï¬€erent types
of spatial data including point processes, lattice data, geostatistical data,
network data, and spatial interaction.  Throughout the course you will gain
valuable hands-on experience with several specialized software packages for
spatial data analysis. The overriding goal of the course is for you to acquire
familiarity with the fundamental methodological and operational issues in the
statistical analysis of geographic information and the ability to extend these
methods in your own research.

The course takes an explicitly computational thinking approach to its
pedagogy. Students are introduced to computational concepts and tools that are
increasingly important to research that engages with geospatial data. By
adopting these tools, students acquire a deeper engagement with, and mastery of,
the substantive concepts. Put differently, students will *learn to code*. But
this is a means to the end goal: students will *code to learn* spatial data
analysis.


In the scope of a 15-week semester course we can only introduce a handful
of the key concepts and methods relevant to the field of spatial data analysis. As
such, the course is not intended as an exhaustive treatment. Instead,
the goal is that students will acquire an understanding of the more
common and useful methods and practices, and use the course as an entry
point for further engagement with the field.

## Prerequisites


- [GEOG 101](https://catalog.sdsu.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=5&coid=31440) or [GEOG 102](https://catalog.sdsu.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=5&coid=31442) 
- [STAT 250](https://catalog.sdsu.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=5&coid=33000) or comparable course in statistics.

All students are required to complete the [prerequisite assessment quiz](https://sdsu.instructure.com/courses/157862/quizzes/324219) before 2024-08-28 3:30pm.

## Computational Learning

We will be using [open
source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) geospatial
software throughout the course together with [Jupyter
Notebooks](https://jupyter.org), and [Python](https://python.org) as our
scripting language.

All software for the course will be made available through
[JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/), a web-based framework. Students
wishing to install these materials on their own machines will be given
instructions to do so, **but this is not required**.

## Readings

All required readings are available through the links listed
below. Assigned readings should be completed before the date listed in
the schedule (see below). Readings are a critical part of the
discussions we will hold in class, and therefore being prepared for class
means having completed the readings and thought about the
content. It will be difficult to do well in this course without having
completed the readings.

## Grading



GEOG 385 uses [specification
grading](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2016/01/19/new-ways-grade-more-effectively-essay)
in evaluating student work and in determining your final course grade.
Your course grade will be based on the quality and quantity of the work
that you submit that is evaluated to be of an acceptable level of
quality. The acceptable level of quality demonstrates competency in the
concepts and methods covered in the course.

There is a two-step process for determination of your final course grade
at the end of the quarter:

1.  Using your quizzes and  exercises, your **base grade** is
    determined.
2.  Using your final exam results, determine if your base grade includes
    a \"plus\", \"minus\", or level drop to form the course grade.


### Base Grade
For Step 1, the base grade is determined using the following
specification:

| Level | Thresholds                             |
|-------|----------------------------------------|
| A-    |  All the B- Thresholds                |
|       |  Pass 11 or more reading quizzes      |
|       |  Participate in 12 or more studios    |
|       |  Complete 4 peer evaluations          |
|       |  Presentation of Computational Essay  |
| B-    |  All the C- Thresholds                |
|       |  Pass 9 or more reading quizzes       |
|       |  Participate in 8 or more studios     |
|       |  Complete 3 peer evaluations          |
|       |  Computational Essay                  |
| C-    |  All the D- Thresholds                |
|       |  Pass 6 or more reading quizzes       |
|       |  Participate in 6 or more studios     |
|       |  Complete 2 peer evaluations          |
| D-    |  Pass 4 or more reading quizzes       |
|       |  Participate in 4 or more studios     |
|       |  Complete 1 peer evaluation           |
| F     |  Failing to clear all the D- Thresholds |


### Final Grade
For Step 2, your final course grade is determined as follows:


If your base grade is not an A-:  

- 2 tokens can increment a  B(C,D)- to a B(CD)
- 3 tokens can increment a B(C,D)- to a B(CD)+

  
If your base grade is an A-:  

- 2 tokens increments an A- to an A
- 3 tokens increments an A- to an A and earns a recommendation certificate

::: {.callout-note}
Note that SDSU grading policy does not allow A+ grades.
:::

 

## Quizzes

Starting in week three, there will be a quiz due before a session that pertains to
the background reading that is required before our work in class.  Quizzes are
graded on a pass/fail basis.


## Studio Participation

Each Wednesday, we will focus on hands-on exercises that explore the
material from lecture. Each student will be assigned to a small group that works
together to carry out a set of spatial data analysis tasks. At the end of the
session each group will submit a single notebook demonstrating their work.


Each notebook is graded using a **CRN** rubric that classifies work with
marks of **C** (\"Demonstrates Competence\"), **R** (\"Needs
Revision\"), or **N** (\"Not assessable\"):

Of each notebook the following questions will be asked: Does the work
demonstrate that the student understands the concepts? Does the work
demonstrate competence and meet the expectations outlined in the
exercise?

If the answer is \"yes\" to both of the questions, the group passes the
hurdle for that studio.

If the initial submission does not clear the hurdle, then a second question is
asked: Is there evidence of partial understanding of the concepts? If the answer
to this question is \"Yes\" the group can exchange one token (from each student)
to attempt a revision of their work. If the answer is \"No\", the group does not
clear the hurdle for this exercise and will not have the opportunity to revise
their work.

For our studio sessions on Wednesdays, it is essential that you bring your own
device, such as a laptop or tablet. These sessions will involve hands-on
activities that require access to software and online resources. Having your own
device will allow you to fully participate and engage with the exercises. Please
ensure your device is charged and ready to use at the start of each studio
session. If you have any concerns about this requirement, please reach out to me
in advance so we can make necessary arrangements.

## Computational Essay


Each student will have the opportunity to write a computational essay using
Jupyter notebooks to apply the methods of ESDA to a topic of their choice,
approved by the instructor. The essay should demonstrate your ability to analyze
spatial data, identify patterns, and interpret the results using ESDA
techniques.

### Instructions

#### 1. Topic Selection

Select a topic of interest that involves spatial data. The topic should be
relevant to your field of study or personal interest. Ensure that the data is
accessible and suitable for spatial analysis. Submit your topic for approval by
the instructor by **September 30**. If you are unsure about a topic, speak to
the professor.

#### 2. Data Acquisition

Identify and acquire spatial data related to your chosen topic. This may include data from public repositories, government databases, or other reliable sources.

#### 3. ESDA Techniques

Apply appropriate ESDA methods such as spatial autocorrelation, clustering, and visualization techniques to explore your data. Use libraries like PySAL, GeoPandas, or others as needed.

#### 4. Analysis and Interpretation

Document your analysis in a Jupyter notebook. Include clear explanations of the methods used, the rationale behind your choices, and a discussion of your findings. Visualizations should be integrated into the narrative to support your analysis.

#### 5. Submission

Submit your Jupyter notebook along with a brief (500-word) reflection on what you learned from the analysis and how ESDA techniques enhanced your understanding of the topic.
At submission you can indicate whether you wish to present your computational
essay during the final period.


:::{.callout-important}

You must demonstrate competency on each of the stages above to have the
computational essay count towards your base grade.
:::


### Deadline

Submit your completed essay  by **December 12, Midnight**.


## Final Exam Activity
Our final exam activity is scheduled for December 18 from 1-3pm. Students who
applied to submit their computational essay will present during this
